# Datenanalyse_2022_23

This repository contains all the tools and methods developed specifically for the course 
“Applied data analysis in bioinformatics” from the masters program “Bioinformatik und Systembiologie” 
at the Justus-Liebig-University and the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen in the wintern term 2022/2023.

The goal of this course is to develop a pipeline for the [Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research](https://www.mpg.de/149809/heart-lung-research)
which takes data from [CATLAS](http://catlas.org/humanenhancer/#!/) and performs distinct analyses mainly based on the so-called chromatin accessibility<sup>[1](#--1-zhang-k-hocker-j-d-miller-m-hou-x-chiou-j-poirion-o-b-qiu-y-li-y-e-gaulton-k-j-wang-a-preissl-s-amp-ren-b--2021---a-single-cell-atlas-of-chromatin-accessibility-in-the-human-genome-cell-184--24---httpsdoiorg101016jcell202110024)</sup>.   
Furthermore, this pipeline is organized into two separate packages (WP1/WP2) due to the group distribution of the course. THE PACKAGES ARE ABOUT ..... Each package contains a rich __README__ explaining all features of the individual package and how to use them. The slides of the final presentation held on the 01.03.23 can be taken from __presentation.pdf__.
