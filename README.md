# Datenanalyse_2022_23

Here we'll describe the results of the master course Datenanalyse

## Presentation

The data we received and calculated ourselves is prone to be presented in different ways. For initial overview over our annotated cells a `dimension reduction` can be used to view how the different cells in our sample are diverging.

<!-- Show Example Dimension Reduction -->

Going into more detail we use a `violin plot` to visually inspect differences between cells in a more detailed manner,

The final plotting device we use to generate data to analyse is the `scatter plot` to plot correlations between different characteristics.
